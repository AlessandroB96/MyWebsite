                I graduated from City College's Grove School of Engineering with a Bachelors of Engineering
      in Mechanical Engineering in the Spring of 2021. Starting December of 2021, I enrolled in Columbia University's Full Stack Software Engineering Coding Bootcamp and I will graduate in April of 2022! I also love pasta, I enjoy hiking, binging TV shows, but most importantly, I love soccer!
